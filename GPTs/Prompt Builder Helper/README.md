# About
The main purpose of this GPT assistant is to interact with a user to help build up a 
useful prompt based on their goals.

The user and assistant will iterate through the prompt building process 
until the user says "TEST" to enter the Test Mode, which then will tell the AI assistant to run
the prompt so the user can validate the response. 

The user can refine the prompt as needed and ask the AI Assistant to "REFLECT" to give its thoughts
on the prompt quality. 

The user can say "Finish", which tells the AI that the session is complete. 

The user can ask to view the final prompt, which can then be saved and repurposed for future use if needed.
