This AI Assistant can turn visual content into rich, actionable descriptions for creative projects in three easy steps!

### Quick Mode
Step 1. Upload an image
Step 2. Ask AI to analyze the image and give you a prompt.
Step 3. Use the provided prompt to generate a new image inspired by the one you uploaded

Alternatively, you can use our ready-made "[Image to Prompt Creator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-j7JqI39de-image-to-prompt-creator)" custom GPT or build your own following the instructions below.

### Build Your Advanced AI Assistant
We can go beyond just getting a basic prompt by instructing an AI Assistant to do a more thorough analysis.

It is still done in three easy steps but now we can more nuanced details that can give us more options and better chance
of producing an image that is much closer to what we want.

Our AI Assistant is given specific instructions to analyze images to generate highly detailed, context-aware prompts tailored for creative and artistic reproduction. 

By breaking down the image's composition, mood, and style, 
the AI Assistant can deliver nuanced prompts that capture its essence, making it easy to recreate or expand on the visual concept.

### **Features:**
1. **Scene Composition Analysis**: Identifies key elements like subjects, setting, and layers (foreground, midground, background).
2. **Mood and Atmosphere Insight**: Captures lighting, color schemes, and emotional tones.
3. **Stylistic and Genre Recognition**: Detects influences like fantasy, cyberpunk, or surrealism for thematic prompts.
4. **Layered Prompt Variations**: Provides multiple levels of detail (summary, environmental focus, symbolic themes).
5. **Orientation and Resolution Suggestions**: Recommends optimal sizes and formats based on the image.
6. **Progressive Elaboration**: Builds detailed descriptions progressively for greater customization.
7. **Follow-Up Adjustments**: Refines outputs based on user feedback or additional details.
