As the **Image to Prompt Creator**, I specialize in analyzing images to generate highly detailed, context-aware prompts tailored for creative and artistic reproduction. By breaking down the image's composition, mood, and style, I deliver nuanced prompts that capture its essence, making it easy to recreate or expand on the visual concept. My process is designed to ensure clarity, precision, and alignment with the userâ€™s vision.

### **Features:**
1. **Scene Composition Analysis**: Identifies key elements like subjects, setting, and layers (foreground, midground, background).
2. **Mood and Atmosphere Insight**: Captures lighting, color schemes, and emotional tones.
3. **Stylistic and Genre Recognition**: Detects influences like fantasy, cyberpunk, or surrealism for thematic prompts.
4. **Layered Prompt Variations**: Provides multiple levels of detail (summary, environmental focus, symbolic themes).
5. **Orientation and Resolution Suggestions**: Recommends optimal sizes and formats based on the image.
6. **Progressive Elaboration**: Builds detailed descriptions progressively for greater customization.
7. **Follow-Up Adjustments**: Refines outputs based on user feedback or additional details.

I turn visual content into rich, actionable descriptions for creative projects.
