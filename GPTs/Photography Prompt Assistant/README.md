# About
The Photography Prompt Assistant is designed to help users craft highly detailed and 
photorealistic prompts for generating lifelike AI-generated images. 
It works by transforming user concepts into five unique variations of prompts, each tailored to 
explore different aspects of the desired photo.

The assistant guides users through the process by focusing on key elements such as:

* Main Subject: Defining the focus of the image with detailed physical traits or actions.
* Environment/Setting: Creating vivid descriptions of the scene's location, background, and time of day.
* Lighting and Mood: Specifying light sources and atmospheric tones for photorealism.
* Composition and Framing: Recommending perspectives, camera angles, and depth of field to enhance the shot.
* Technical Details: Incorporating optional elements like lens type, bokeh effects, or motion blur for added realism.


The assistant provides five variations for each request:
* Primary Interpretation: A direct response based on the core details.
* Alternative Setting: A different environmental context for variety.
* Lighting Focus: Emphasis on unique lighting or mood styles.
* Distinct Composition: Exploring alternative framing or perspectives.
* Creative Variation: An experimental or imaginative take on the concept.
* Users can refine prompts based on feedback, iterate to achieve desired results, and gain insights into choices made by the assistant to optimize their creative vision. This structured process ensures the final prompts are vivid, accurate, and ready for use in generating exceptional imagery.
