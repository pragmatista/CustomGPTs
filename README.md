# CustomGPTs
This repository contains all of my OpenAI custom GPTs with full instructions and implementation steps.

## About Custom GPTs
These instructions are specific to creating a custom GPT using OpenAI's GPT builder, 
which requires a paid subscription. You can, however, use the provided instructions within
a normal chat session in any tool like ChatGPT, Claud, Gemini, etc.
